Will implement a debug mode both to track progress quickly, and stay true to the original; as it had its own debug room

Audio is uncompressed (for now), and both references local media or youtube-dl to save download times

This is a fan-game, I've no association with Studio Trophis nor the wonderful staff at Studio Trophis.
For Audio support, you'll want to have youtube-dl and mpv installed from your package manager of choice.
